# About Me

I'm currently in my final year at **G.H. Patel College of Engineering & Technology**.

I'm someone who enjoys exploring different areas of technology, from frontend development and backend systems to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Iâ€™m always looking to learn something new and build things that solve real-world problems. My focus is on writing clean, scalable code and building solid project structures that are easy to maintain and extend.

# Internship Experience â€“ Full Stack MERN Internship

Completed a 15-day hands-on internship focused on building full-stack applications using the MERN stack. Worked on both frontend and backend parts of web and mobile projects.

## Frontend Highlights
- Built mobile and web-based To-Do applications using ReactJS and React Native
- Used modern practices like hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`), Context API, Redux Toolkit, and routing
- Applied libraries like Lodash, react-toastify, and Formik/Yup for form handling and alerts
- Gained experience in performance optimization and state management

## Backend Highlights
- Developed APIs using Node.js and Express.js
- Implemented RESTful architecture and HTTP method handling
- Worked with MongoDB and Mongoose for database operations
- Created secure login systems using JWT
- Integrated backend with frontend using proper API structures

## Dev Concepts Covered
- JavaScript internals (hoisting, const vs let, immutability)
- Project architecture following MVC structure
- Real-world insights from working developers
- Email verification systems using EmailJS and NodeMailer
