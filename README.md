## Hello World ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

I'm currently in my final year at **G.H. Patel College of Engineering & Technology**.

I'm someone who enjoys exploring different areas of technology, from frontend development and backend systems to machine learning and artificial intelligence. Iâ€™m always looking to learn something new and build things that solve real-world problems. My focus is on writing clean, scalable code and building solid project structures that are easy to maintain and extend.

# Internship Experience â€“ Full Stack MERN Internship

Completed a 15-day hands-on internship focused on building web applications using the **MERN stack**. Worked on both frontend and backend, with exposure to modern tools, state management, and full-stack project structure.

## React (Frontend)
- Built responsive interfaces using **React.js**
- Worked with functional components, routing, and state management
- Used **Context API** and **Redux Toolkit** for global state
- Integrated external APIs using `useEffect`
- Applied form handling with **Formik** and validation using **Yup**
- Styled apps with **Tailwind CSS**
- Added utility features using **Lodash**, and feedback using **react-toastify**, **react-hot-toast**

## Node.js & Express.js (Backend)
- Developed RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**
- Handled routes, middleware, and server structure
- Built authentication flow using **JWT**
- Used **EmailJS** and **NodeMailer** for OTP verification and SMTP email sending

## MongoDB & Mongoose
- Performed full CRUD operations with **MongoDB**
- Designed schemas and managed data using **Mongoose**
- Integrated backend APIs with MongoDB for real-time data flow

## Key Concepts & Practices
- Explored JavaScript fundamentals in depth: hoisting, `const` vs `let`, immutability
- Organized code using the MVC architecture
- Gained insight into real-world dev patterns, tools, and scalability practices
