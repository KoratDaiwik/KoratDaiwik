## 👋 Hello World

### I'm Daiwik Korat — Final Year Computer Engineering Student

Currently in my final year at **G.H. Patel College of Engineering & Technology**.  
I enjoy exploring different areas of technology — from frontend and backend development to machine learning and systems thinking.

I'm focused on writing clean, scalable code and building real-world solutions through continuous learning.
